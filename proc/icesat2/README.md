# ICESat-2 pre-processing

Just a quick subsetter for ICESat-2 to generate the pickle file in the main data archive at is2/MercerSubglacialLake.is2.atl06.004.pkl`. This notebook pulls in the list of individual ATL06 `.h5` files in `slm_filelist.txt` and subsets them to the appropriate region, saving a pickle file.
